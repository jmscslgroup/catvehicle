About CATvehicle
----------------------

The CAT Vehicle (Cognitive and Autonomous Test Vehicle) Testbed is a research testbed comprised of a distributed simulation-based autonomous vehicle, 
with straightforward transition to hardware in the loop testing and execution, to support research in autonomous driving technology.
The testbed includes a simulated physics-based model of the autonomous vehicle that mimics a real world vehicle
capable of driving autonomously. In addition, the simulator provides support to spawn multiple autonomous vehicle
in simulation that facilitates the development of application requiring multi-vehicle scenario.

**CAT Vehicle** is ROS package for Autonomous Vehicle Simulation that facilitates the development of Connected-and-Autonomous Vehicle applications.
