CAT Vehicle Testbed provides a ROS package **catvehicle** that a ROS based simulator to facilitate the development 
of autonomous vehicle applications. This repository houses the files that utilize the Gazebo simulator, and 
additional interfaces to the physical CAT Vehicle Testbed available at the University of Arizona - Department of 
Electrical and Computer Engineering.


The testbed includes a simulated physics-based model of the autonomous vehicle that mimics a real world vehicle
capable of driving autonomously. In addition to that, simulator provides support to spawn multiple autonomous vehicle
in simulation that facilitates the development of application requiring multi-vehicle scenario.
