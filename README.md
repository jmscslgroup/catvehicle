# Cognitive and Autonomous Test Vehicle (CAT Vehicle) Testbed
The CAT Vehicle is a ROS based simulator to facilitate the development of autonomous vehicle applications. This repository houses the files that utilize the Gazebo simulator, and additional interfaces to the physical CAT Vehicle Testbed available at the University of Arizona - Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.

# What's new
* Released for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, ROS Melodic and Gazebo 9.0
* Support for front camera
* More stable vehicle dynamics
* Bug fixes and improvements

# How to use it

## Installing ROS
* Follow the steps mentioned in the [ROS wiki page](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu%C2%A0) on how to install ROS Melodic. 
* In addition to that we are required to install some additional ros packages
```shell
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-velodyne ros-melodic-novatel-span-driver
```

## Creating catkin workspace
In order to use the catvehicle ROS package, you should work within a catkin workspace. If you do not already have one:
```shell
cd ~
mkdir -p catvehicle_ws/src
cd catvehicle_ws/src
catkin_init_workspace
cd ..
catkin_make
```

At this point, you can clone this repo and other dependent package into your src directory
```shell
cd ~/catvehicle_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/jmscslgroup/catvehicle
git clone https://github.com/jmscslgroup/obstaclestopper
git clone https://github.com/jmscslgroup/control_toolbox
git clone https://github.com/jmscslgroup/sicktoolbox
git clone https://github.com/jmscslgroup/sicktoolbox_wrapper
git clone https://github.com/jmscslgroup/stepvel
git clone https://github.com/jmscslgroup/cmdvel2gazebo
git clone https://github.com/jmscslgroup/velodyne
cd ..
catkin_make
```
## Sourcing workspace to the environment path
```bash
echo "source ~/catvehicle_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

# Simple tutorial and examples
Follow the tutorials on the CAT Vehicle Testbed group on the [CPS Virtual Organization](https://cps-vo.org/group/CATVehicleTestbed) to see how to use the testbed.

# Issues
If you run into a problem, please feel free to post to [issues](https://github.com/jmscslgroup/catvehicle/issues). If the issue is urgent, please email to catvehicle@list.arizona.edu.
