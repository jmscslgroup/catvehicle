Virtualization Environment Installation 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is the installation of virtual software to host Ubuntu 20.04. 
There are several virtualization softwares. We recommend using VMWare which is provided through The University of Arizona software licensing. 
If you are running windows, you may also use dual boot. 
In this section we wil go over how to install VMWare on your machine. 

.. note:: 
    If you have an Ubuntu running system, you do not need to install a virtual machine software. 
    This tutorial does not go over how to install VirtualBox or Dual boot, though those are options. 

VMware
^^^^^^^^^
For this section you may use the `Software License <https://e5.onthehub.com/WebStore/ProductsByMajorVersionList.aspx?cmi_cs=1&cmi_mnuMain=16a020b5-ed3c-df11-b4ab-0030487d8897&ws=c6fcd2a5-a432-de11-9d57-0030485a8df0&vsro=8>`_ through The University of Arizona.
If you do not have an account, you may use the `Free VMware for  Windows or Linux. <https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_work station_player/15_0>`_ 
For Mac you need the `Free Fusion VMware License. <https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_work station_player/15_0>`_

.. caution::
    Make sure to choose VMware Workstation 16.x Pro for a Windows or Linux computer 
    and VMware Fusion 12 Pro for Mac. 

For Mac:
=========
Once you have downloaded VMware Fusion 12 Pro, open the disk image file and double click to install. 
You will get a pop up saying "VMware Fusion is an app downloaded from the internet", go ahead and open it. 
Then you need to authenticate and allow the application to run.
After the initialization screen, allow the system extension to proceed through the system preference. 
To do this you need to click on the open system preference, and allow for the system extension. 
Agree to the Lincense. 

.. note:: 
    If you were able to download VMWare through The University of Arizona, go ahead and enter the license number. 
    If you got it through the website for free, go ahead and select the option to try VMware for 30 days. 

Click Done after the installation has been completed. 
Next we will take a look on how to install Ubuntu. 



For Windows: 
==============
Once you have downloaded VMware Workstation 16x Pro, open the disk image file right click on it and run as an administrator. 
Click next on all the windows, if you obtained the license through The University of Arizona, you may enter the license number. 
If not you may do select the 30 day trial. 

VirtualBox
^^^^^^^^^^^^
You may download `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads>`_ from its website. 
Select your computer's operating system. Once downloaded, you may install it. 

Dual Boot
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This option works well with Windows already installed. You will need an empty USB drive.
